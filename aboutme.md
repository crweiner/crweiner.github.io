Hi Internet!

![octocat](/img/small-octocat.png){:class="img-responsive"}

My name is Chandler Weiner and I'm a jack of all trades. 

I am a biologist by day, WordPress web designer by night, and traveler by weekend. 

While this site is a static [Jekyll Blog](https://jekyllrb.com/) running the [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) theme, my first love is WordPress and all that it has to offer!

If you're in the market for an incredible WordPress website where someone can obsess over it as much as you do, then check out my business at [ObsessiveWP](https://obsessivewp.com).

Are you in the mood to learn how to travel for free? I've been lucky to travel the world for next-to-nothing thanks to points and miles. Want to join me? Learn how at [The Infrequent Flyer Blog](https://www.infrequentflyer.blog/).

I run a few silly projects in my spare time on GitHub, like the [Hacktoberfest Swag List](https://hacktoberfestswaglist.com/) where you can earn free swag every October by contributing to Open Source projects. I'm also building two bots; one that corrects spellings of "they're", "their", and "there", and another bot that suggests license files for projects.

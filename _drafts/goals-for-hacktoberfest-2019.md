There's no secret that I really enjoy Hacktoberfest. If you follow me on Twitter, you'll see that the entire month of October is nearly reserved for talking about Hacktoberfest.

This year marks my third year participating in Hacktoberfest and it is something I am very proud of. Because of this event, I've started teaching myself Python, R, and started dabbling in Ruby. I entirely have this holiday to thank for giving me the kick that I need to learn how to code and I am very thankful to every company and individual that has to still brave through my contributions and pull requests. :-)

Last year marked the introduction of a little project I called the [Hacktoberfest Swag List](https://hacktoberfestswaglist.com/ "Hacktoberfest Swag List"). Once I realized that Microsoft and SendGrid were offering their own t-shirts and stickers to people who helped out in their own GitHub repos, I made a [very simple public list](https://github.com/crweiner/hacktoberfest-swag-list/tree/30965cec8ac3d3654a16972e6e1e09f3044146d8 "Old swag list code") so I could keep track of it all and asked for others to contribute.

My goal shifted from simply providing _me_ with a list of swag to providing _everyone_ with a list, particularly targeted at people new to coding who wanted to feel a sense of accomplishment for helping companies they know and use. 

To accomplish this goal, I experimented with turning the list into a GitHub Pages site powered by Jekyll. That then lead to me learning how to use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/ "Netlify") to host a website, how to setup [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll") as a static site generator locally, learning how to better my Markdown coding with [CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com/ "CodeClimate"), how to configure webhooks, and how to be a manager in charge of a public project that people relied upon.

I want for the Hacktoberfest Swag List to be as simple as can be. There are only 2 files for people to edit and if you can contribute right from GitHub without installing any software of your own. I wanted for the list to remain absolutely minimal with the website as small and simple as can be. That way, no matter where you are in the world and how terrible your connection to the internet may be, you'll have the chance to load up a site and learn about companies that support you in making the open-source world a better place.

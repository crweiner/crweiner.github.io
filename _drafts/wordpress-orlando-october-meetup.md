Hello WordPress People!

I'm honored to be presenting a talk at the WordPress Orlando October Meetup titled **_Hacktoberfest 2019: Git, GitHub, and WordPress._**

This talk covers the very basics of Git and GitHub as well as dives into how Git/GitHub are useful to people who build WordPress sites. Then, I talk about using your new Git skills to participate in Hacktoberfest and earn sweet, sweet swag by helping out open-source projects, such as the many that are WordPress related!

Soon to come: Video of the presentation.

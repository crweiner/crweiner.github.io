Well, that's it. The wonderful holiday of [Hacktoberfest](http://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com "Hacktoberfest website") has come to a close. One month full of open-source hacking and contributions is now over.

So, what does this mean for the [Hacktoberfest Swag List](https://hacktoberfestswaglist.com/ "Hacktoberfest Swag List")?

I thought this would be a great time to dive into the analytics and stats of my little project to see who it helped, where the visitors were coming from, and learn about what I can change for Hacktoberfest 2020.

## Hacktoberfest Swag List 2019 - Day 1

Day 1 (or perhaps Day 0?) on September 30th started off with a smashing success. Between my own list and [another one](https://github.com/benbarth/hacktoberfest-swag "Hacktoberfest List") that I help to maintain, I woke up to over 60 emails from people contributing to the Swag List and notifications from some of the bots I have watching over things.

## SEO Rankings and Google Search Results

I was very shocked to see how the vast majority of traffic to the Hacktoberfest Swag List came from Google search results:

Searching for "Hacktoberfest" or "Hacktoberfest 2019" or "Hacktoberfest swag" in Google brought up the Hacktoberfest Swag List in the #3 - #5 position every time! For those wondering, yes, that is through Incognito mode and even when connected to a VPN and routing through a different part of the USA.
